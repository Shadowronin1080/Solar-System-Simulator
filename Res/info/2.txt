
What is it:
Spirographs are bassed of an old toy used to display patterns
these are the spirorapgs of two different planets 
they are patterns generated that show you 
how the orbits of each planet are different and are a fun visual aid


How to Use the Simulation:

- choose the closer planet from the menu on the right
- Choose the further planet from the menu on the left

THE MATHS BEHIND IT:

At every point in one orbit of the planet a line is being drawn 
to the possition of the other planet at that point

This reasults in cool and visually characteristic geometric pattern
