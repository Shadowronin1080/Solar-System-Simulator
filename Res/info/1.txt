what is it :
these are the orbits of all the planets in our solar system
you can also see how they move at different rates

How to Use the Simulation:

- Choose which planets you want to animate by clicking the tick boxes
- UnTick the box next to animate if you only want to see the orbits
- Drag the slider to change the time step (will revert back once let go)
- use your arrow keys to navigate to the slider to enter a custom value


THE PHSYICS BEHIND IT:

Newtons law of gravity is the central law that can be used to explain
Planetary motion.       F = G * (M1 * M2)/R^2
the force between the planets is the gravitaional constant (G) 
into the product of the masses devided by the square of the distance between them.

Keplars laws and newtons law of gravity can be used in tandam to derive the 
Polar equation of an elipse  r = (a(1-e^2))/1-e*cos(theta)

this equation gives you the distance betwwen the planet and the sun at given 
angles of the planet (0 - 2pi)
