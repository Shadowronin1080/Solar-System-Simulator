What is it:
This section includes relitive orbits of 
every other planet relitive to a centre planet of your choice

How to Use it:

- Use the drop down to select the planet you want to set as your centre planet
- Use the tick boxes to select all the other planets whose relitive orbits you want to view 
- Use the slider to select the number of complete periods of the centre planet you want to 
  display all the other orbits for

The maths behind it:

Geting the relitive orbits is as simple as subracting the coordinates of
centre planet relitive to the sun at that point from the coordinates of the other planet
