# Solar-System-Simulator
🌌 Solar System Simulator

A physics-based solar system simulator written in C++, featuring a custom-built graphics wrapper for rendering. The project models planetary motion using Newtonian gravity and visualizes orbits, velocities, and interactions between celestial bodies in real time.

✨ Features

Newtonian gravity simulation with configurable parameters (mass, velocity, position)

Real-time rendering powered by a lightweight custom graphics wrapper

Scalable design for adding/removing celestial bodies

Smooth orbital animations and trajectory visualization

Adjustable simulation speed and camera controls

🛠️ Built With

C++17

Custom Graphics Wrapper (built from scratch to handle rendering and animation)

Standard Template Library (STL)

🚀 Future Enhancements

3D visualization and planetary textures

Collision detection and dynamic body creation

Improved UI overlays (distance, speed, energy)

Save/load simulation configurations
